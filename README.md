A closer look into the history of the 1st and 2nd US Banks

Abstract: 
This paper examines the first and second U.S. Banks, focusing on its charter, development, operations, and eventual dissolution. While today we live in a fiat currency system, where money is not directly backed by physical commodities like gold or silver, it is important to understand the historical context in which the first U.S. Bank operated. At that time, the economy was unstable, and the young American government faced significant concerns about debt. Unlike modern monetary theory, which focuses on money supply, velocity, price levels, and economic growth, the key issue for the founders was not the quantity of money in circulation but the value of the banknotes issued by individual banks.

The value of these banknotes was directly tied to the amount of specie (gold and silver) that each bank held in reserve. Additionally, a critical concern was whether banknotes issued by one bank would be accepted by other banks, allowing their holders to withdraw funds at different locations or branches. In this context, this paper will explore two main questions: (1) What was the significance of the specie deposits for the first U.S. Bank, and (2) What factors determined the relative value of banknotes issued by different banks during that time.

This exploration will shed light on how early American banking systems differed from our modern understanding of money and highlight the role of specie reserves and inter-bank trust in maintaining the stability and value of currency.

Introduction:
After the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776, the war left the newly established government with an enormous debt responsibility. The founding fathers in Congress were debating the possible ways to repay this debt and at the same time were asked to establish a national bank to help repay this debt, but the question was, if they chose to do it, how would such an institution operate?
Looking back, the establishment of the Bank of the United States in 1791 was undoubtedly an essential part of the general scheme to support public credit, but establishing it was not a simple task - in fact, the first Secretary of the Treasury had to fight hard for it and yes, I am talking about Alexander Hamilton, who had proposed the establishment of a U.S. Bank several times before the charter passed.
The Plan of 1779: As Hamilton served in the army, he wrote to Robert Morris proposing a way
to preserve the country’s currency and get wealthy people to cooperate with the government by
establishing an American bank.
– He proposed a bank with $200,000,000 in capital, including a foreign loan of $10,000,000 as
part of the bank’s stock.
– The government would guarantee one-twentieth of the subscription money to the stockholders,
who would share half of the bank’s stock and profits.
– The bank would be required to lend Congress £2,000,000 annually at 4 percent interest.
• The Plan of 1781: In a second attempt, Hamilton proposed a new bank to Robert Morris, now the
Superintendent of Finance.
– The bank would have a capital of £3,000,000.
– A loan of £1,200,000 at 8 percent interest was to be made to Congress, with a sinking fund
of £110,400 per year for 20 years to repay it, backed by state pledges.
– The bank would be chartered for thirty years, and no other banks would be permitted during
that period.
– Three agencies were to be established in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to
facilitate the circulation and payment of notes.
– Hamilton suggested that these agencies be located in the interior, distant from trading centers,
to make the payment of banknotes less convenient.
– Management would consist of 12 directors: 8 chosen by stockholders, and 4 by Congress.
• Report of 1790: Hamilton submitted a detailed report on a bank funded under a national charter,
highlighting two key advantages:
– The augmentation of a country’s active or productive capital.
– The advantage of a bank in making loans to the government.
• Bank Charter Bill: After much debate, the bill to charter the Bank of the United States was
introduced in the Senate on December 23, 1790.
– It was debated until January 20, when it was sent to the House.
– On January 31, the House considered the bill in the Committee of the Whole, with James
Madison and many Southern members opposing it.
– Despite the opposition, President George Washington signed the bill into law on February 25,
1791.


THE CHARTER OF THE 1ST US BANK
The charter for the 1st US Bank provisioned the following: The bill provided for a Bank of the United
States to be located in Philadelphia with a $10,000,000 capital divided into 25,000 shares of $400 each.
One-fourth of all private and corporate subscriptions were to be paid in specie, and three-fourths in United
States stock bearing 6 percent interest, payable in four equal semi-annual payments. The President of
the United States was authorized to subscribe, on behalf of the United States, $2,000,000, a loan of
equal amount to be made by the bank, which was to be reimbursed in 10 equal annual installments.
No subscription other than that of the Government was to exceed 1,000 shares. There were to be 25
directors, up to three-fourths of whom were eligible for reelection the following year. The directors were
to elect a president who was to receive a salary, but they were to serve without compensation. No foreign
stockholder might vote by proxy. One share was to have * vote, three shares, two votes, five shares, three
votes, and so on until 100 shares had 20 votes. The bank was allowed to issue notes, payable to any person
or persons, assignable and negotiable, or to bearer assignable by delivery. The notes were legal tender in
payment of all debts to the United States.
However, in order to truly understand how the 1st Bank of the United States operated we need to take
a closer look at the available data and reports.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND TIMELINE
• 1790 - Proposal and Debate: Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, proposed
the creation of a national bank to stabilize and improve the nation’s credit and manage government
revenue. As we saw above, Hamilton had created several proposals each with different proposi-
tions. Nonetheless, the last one, which was being debated, faced strong opposition from some
founding fathers including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who argued that the bank was
unconstitutional and would concentrate too much power in the federal government.

• February 25, 1791 - Charter Signed: President George Washington signed the charter for the First
Bank of the United States, officially establishing it with a 20-year term. The bank was headquartered
in Philadelphia and had branches in other major cities. (Figures 2 and 3)
• 1791 - Bank Operations Begin: The bank began operations, acting as the U.S. government’s fiscal
agent. It collected taxes, disbursed government payments, and issued notes. It was also responsible
for holding federal funds and providing loans to the government and private businesses. (Figure 4)
• 1791–1800s - Economic Impact: The bank played a significant role in stabilizing the fledgling
American economy, facilitating trade, and promoting business activities. It became the largest
financial institution in the United States and influenced monetary policy by controlling credit and
lending.
• End of Charter: As the bank’s 20-year charter was set to expire, Congress debated whether to
renew it. Political divisions and concerns over its constitutionality and economic power led to
resistance against renewal.
• March 4, 1811 - Charter Expiration: The charter for the First Bank of the United States was not
renewed, and the bank ceased operations. The opposition, including many agrarian and state-rights
advocates, succeeded in preventing the renewal, leading to the bank’s closure. The wealthy banker
Stephen Girard purchased the bank building and the cashier’s house. During the upcoming years
(including the War of 1812), his bank served the government and underwrote around 95% of the
loans. Yet, that is a story for another time.

In this report, I rely heavily on primary sources to gather the data for the 1st US Bank. The book by
John Thom Holdsworth and Davis R. Dewey titled ”The First and Second Banks of the United States”,
served as a main guide for the timeline and data used to understand and explain the 1st U.S. Bank.
Furthermore, the reports from Hamilton and Galatin were revisited and reviewed to ensure accuracy as
archives and availability permitted. Lastly, I use python to manage and plot the available data to create
easy to understand visualizations to contribute to the holistic understanding of the 1st US Bank.
