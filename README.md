Title: A closer look into the history of the 1st and 2nd US Banks.

Abstract: 
This report examines the first and second U.S. Banks, focusing on its charter, development, operations, and eventual dissolution. While today we live in a fiat currency system, where money is not directly backed by physical commodities like gold or silver, it is important to understand the historical context in which the first U.S. Bank operated. At that time, the economy was unstable, and the young American government faced significant concerns about debt. Unlike modern monetary theory, which focuses on money supply, velocity, price levels, and economic growth, the key issue for the founders was not the quantity of money in circulation but the value of the banknotes issued by individual banks.

The value of these banknotes was directly tied to the amount of specie (gold and silver) that each bank held in reserve. Additionally, a critical concern was whether banknotes issued by one bank would be accepted by other banks, allowing their holders to withdraw funds at different locations or branches. I will explore two main questions: (1) What was the significance of the specie deposits for the first U.S. Bank, and (2) What factors determined the relative value of banknotes issued by different banks during that time.

This exploration will shed light on how early American banking systems differed from our modern understanding of money and highlight the role of specie reserves and inter-bank trust in maintaining the stability and value of currency.

Introduction:
After the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776, the war left the newly established government with an enormous debt responsibility. The founding fathers in Congress were debating the possible ways to repay this debt and at the same time were asked to establish a national bank to help repay this debt, but the question was, if they chose to do it, how would such an institution operate?
Looking back, the establishment of the Bank of the United States in 1791 was undoubtedly an essential part of the general scheme to support public credit, but establishing it was not a simple task - in fact, the first Secretary of the Treasury had to fight hard for it and yes, I am talking about Alexander Hamilton, who had proposed the establishment of a U.S. Bank several times before the charter passed.

As Hamilton served in the army, he wrote to Robert Morris proposing a way
to preserve the country’s currency and get wealthy people to cooperate with the government by
establishing an American bank.
– He proposed a bank with $200,000,000 in capital, including a foreign loan of $10,000,000 as
part of the bank’s stock.
– The government would guarantee one-twentieth of the subscription money to the stockholders,
who would share half of the bank’s stock and profits.
– The bank would be required to lend Congress £2,000,000 annually at 4 percent interest.
• The Plan of 1781: In a second attempt, Hamilton proposed a new bank to Robert Morris, now the
Superintendent of Finance.
– The bank would have a capital of £3,000,000.
– A loan of £1,200,000 at 8 percent interest was to be made to Congress, with a sinking fund
of £110,400 per year for 20 years to repay it, backed by state pledges.
– The bank would be chartered for thirty years, and no other banks would be permitted during
that period.
– Three agencies were to be established in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to
facilitate the circulation and payment of notes.
– Hamilton suggested that these agencies be located in the interior, distant from trading centers,
to make the payment of banknotes less convenient.
– Management would consist of 12 directors: 8 chosen by stockholders, and 4 by Congress.
• Report of 1790: Hamilton submitted a detailed report on a bank funded under a national charter,
highlighting two key advantages:
– The augmentation of a country’s active or productive capital.
– The advantage of a bank in making loans to the government.
• Bank Charter Bill: After much debate, the bill to charter the Bank of the United States was
introduced in the Senate on December 23, 1790.
– It was debated until January 20, when it was sent to the House.
– On January 31, the House considered the bill in the Committee of the Whole, with James
Madison and many Southern members opposing it.
– Despite the opposition, President George Washington signed the bill into law on February 25,
1791.


THE CHARTER OF THE 1ST US BANK
The charter for the 1st US Bank provisioned the following: The bill provided for a Bank of the United
States to be located in Philadelphia with a $10,000,000 capital divided into 25,000 shares of $400 each.
One-fourth of all private and corporate subscriptions were to be paid in specie, and three-fourths in United
States stock bearing 6 percent interest, payable in four equal semi-annual payments. The President of
the United States was authorized to subscribe, on behalf of the United States, $2,000,000, a loan of
equal amount to be made by the bank, which was to be reimbursed in 10 equal annual installments.
No subscription other than that of the Government was to exceed 1,000 shares. There were to be 25
directors, up to three-fourths of whom were eligible for reelection the following year. The directors were
to elect a president who was to receive a salary, but they were to serve without compensation. No foreign
stockholder might vote by proxy. One share was to have * vote, three shares, two votes, five shares, three
votes, and so on until 100 shares had 20 votes. The bank was allowed to issue notes, payable to any person
or persons, assignable and negotiable, or to bearer assignable by delivery. The notes were legal tender in
payment of all debts to the United States.
However, in order to truly understand how the 1st Bank of the United States operated we need to take
a closer look at the available data and reports.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND TIMELINE
• 1790 - Proposal and Debate: Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, proposed
the creation of a national bank to stabilize and improve the nation’s credit and manage government
revenue. As we saw above, Hamilton had created several proposals each with different proposi-
tions. Nonetheless, the last one, which was being debated, faced strong opposition from some
founding fathers including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who argued that the bank was
unconstitutional and would concentrate too much power in the federal government.

• February 25, 1791 - Charter Signed: President George Washington signed the charter for the First
Bank of the United States, officially establishing it with a 20-year term. The bank was headquartered
in Philadelphia and had branches in other major cities. (Figures 2 and 3)
• 1791 - Bank Operations Begin: The bank began operations, acting as the U.S. government’s fiscal
agent. It collected taxes, disbursed government payments, and issued notes. It was also responsible
for holding federal funds and providing loans to the government and private businesses. (Figure 4)
• 1791–1800s - Economic Impact: The bank played a significant role in stabilizing the fledgling
American economy, facilitating trade, and promoting business activities. It became the largest
financial institution in the United States and influenced monetary policy by controlling credit and
lending.
• End of Charter: As the bank’s 20-year charter was set to expire, Congress debated whether to
renew it. Political divisions and concerns over its constitutionality and economic power led to
resistance against renewal.
• March 4, 1811 - Charter Expiration: The charter for the First Bank of the United States was not
renewed, and the bank ceased operations. The opposition, including many agrarian and state-rights
advocates, succeeded in preventing the renewal, leading to the bank’s closure. The wealthy banker
Stephen Girard purchased the bank building and the cashier’s house. During the upcoming years
(including the War of 1812), his bank served the government and underwrote around 95% of the
loans. Yet, that is a story for another time.

In this report, I rely heavily on primary sources to gather the data for the 1st US Bank. The book by
John Thom Holdsworth and Davis R. Dewey titled ”The First and Second Banks of the United States”,
served as a main guide for the timeline and data used to understand and explain the 1st U.S. Bank.
Furthermore, the reports from Hamilton and Galatin were revisited and reviewed to ensure accuracy as
archives and availability permitted. Lastly, I use python to manage and plot the available data to create
easy to understand visualizations to contribute to the holistic understanding of the 1st US Bank.

Lessons from the 1st US Bank:

- Specie: As we know and is clearly pointed ou by the graphs showing the reserves of the 1st US Bank, specie was the basis of banking stability. Since the 1st US Bank was required to maintain specie resevres to back up the notes it issued. Specie served as a benchmark for the bank's solvency, ensuring that paper money could be redeemed for tangible assets. Specie was universally recognized and trusted, which made it a critical asset for settling balances with foreign entities.Specie played a central role in debates between Federalists (who supported the bank) and Jeffersonian Republicans (who opposed it). Federalists viewed specie-backed banknotes as essential to economic growth, while opponents worried about over-centralization and its impact on farmers and local economies. Nonetheless, when the charter of the 1st US Bank ended we can see how peope wiht different political perspectives acknoledged the positive impact the bank had for the facilitation of transactions in the economy.

- Notes: The notes issued by the First Bank contributed to the standardization of paper money in the U.S., offering a uniform and recognizable medium of exchange. Unlike the diverse and often untrustworthy state banknotes, First Bank notes were accepted nationally, facilitating interstate commerce and economic cohesion. The issuance of First Bank notes was tightly linked to its specie reserves. This system reinforced the principle that paper money should be convertible to a tangible asset (gold or silver), ensuring stability in the money supply. The issuance and management of notes by the First Bank underscored the need for balance: enough notes to stimulate the economy, but not so many as to cause inflation or risk a loss of confidence in their value.

- Stephen Girard's impact: Perhaphs you've heard of the very welathy banker and bsiness man Steohen Girard, but there is a lot about him that doesn;t get mentioned. When the charter for the 1st US Bank ended, a gorup of people were very supportive of a renewal of the charter while other were still skeptical that givign a single institutiton so much monetary poweer would create disadvantages for farmers and agriculture. So the following years the charter was not renewed until the 2nd US Bank. However, Girard took the matter into his own hands and purchased the bank, named it 'Girard's Bank' and backed up many of the loans done by the governemnt during the war of 1812.

In time line term:
- 1811: The charter for the 1st U.S. bank ended, where Girard purchased the bank building and the cashier's house for \$120,000.

- 1812: Girard opened his banking house with an initial capital of \$1,200,000.

- 1813: His wealth increased the bank's capital to  \$1,300,000. In addition, the trustees of the 1st U.S. Bank's business were immediately transferred to Girard's Bank, which had an additional \$5,000,000. Girard's bank also issued its notes, and although initially questioned, all banks accepted them. However, he executed a deed of trust vesting five prominent citizens all the bank's property when he passed away. The record says that Girard's Bank was the principal source of government credit during the War of 1812, and Girard underwrote 95\% of the war loan issue, which enabled the United States to carry on the war.

1831: Girard died, and the trustees transferred assets worth over \$ 4 million to the person responsible for managing his estate, as outlined in his will. Girard's fortune and assets, including the bank, were placed in a trust, with most of his wealth designated to philanthropic causes, notably Girard College, a school for orphaned boys. Nonetheless, since the bank left a vacant spot, a group of capitalists organized a "Girard's bank" and secured a state charter in 1832.

1837: The Bank had struggled due to the Panic of 1837, which was triggered by domestic and international factors that strained the banking system and led to widespread business failures, high unemployment, and a collapse in property prices. Something new I learned about was that President Andrew Jackson issued the Specie Circular in 1836, requiring that government land purchases be made with gold or silver (specie) rather than paper currency. This move aimed to curb land speculation but drastically reduced the money supply, as many banks needed more specie to back their notes. I think this is where the previous information we've been seeing in the reports of the banks on how much they had in species compared to how much they had in total deposits becomes more relevant. 

1983: It looks like Girard's bank (the one managed by the group of capitalists after his death) was acquired by Mellon Bank this year and two decades later by Citizens Bank, so if you have an account on Citizens Bank.

ALthough we can see that Girard was undoubtly a strong foundation for the banking system post 1st US Bank, he had adviced many other decision of the then US Treasury Secretary Dallas. I would recommend reading "Finance and Enterprice in Early America: A study of Girard's Bank: 1812-1831."

Lessons from the 2nd US Bank:
- On January 4, 1814, a petition from New York was presented: "praying for the incorporation of a national bank, with a capital of \$30,000,000." However, the Committee on Ways and Means had adversely reported that it was unconstitutional to "create corporations within the territorial limits of the States without the consent of the States." Thus, to solve this disagreement, the politician John Calhoun proposed the establishment of a bank in the District of Columbia, but this was open to the objection that it would not furnish a national currency unless branches in several States were permitted, which is the initial stage of a very debated attempt to establish a new charter for a 2nd national bank for the United States. 

At the same time, in September 1814, there was a crisis for Species in the country, and the Secretary of the Treasury Dallas expressed that establishing a national bank was the only efficient remedy for the disordered condition of our circulating medium. Thus, under the new circumstance, the Committee on Ways and Means promptly
reported a bill to establish a bank founded on Specie and government war stock. However, one exciting element of the proposal was that it would grant the President of the United States power to suspend specie payments when such suspension seemed necessary, which faced much opposition from the constructionists, the Federalists, and the Republicans.

As a result, Calhoun introduced a bill providing for a bank with a capital of \$50,000,000 founded on specie and treasury notes, with no authority for suspending specie payments. However, When this bill passed, it met President Madison's disapproval, who returned a veto because the proposed bank would not revive public credit, provide a national circulation medium, aid the Treasury by facilitating revenue anticipation, or afford more durable loans. 

Nonetheless, when the War of 1812 ended, there was no longer a need to make procuring loans the bank's primary objective, which removed the ground for opposition for Dallas and Calhoun. Now, the primary focus of the proposers of the 2nd US Bank was no longer to fund the public debt but to settle the currency and resume specie payment. 

Dallas argued that the state banks could not successfully furnish a uniform national currency alone, and the government needed to be in a position to force the banks to. Surprisingly, President Madison also favored a bank in his annual message. On January 8, 1816, a new bill was reported providing a bank with charter provisions similar to the First Bank's.

The Charter:
The bank was established to restore financial order, regulate the nation’s currency, and provide a stable mechanism for managing federal funds. With a capitalization of \$35 million, it became one of the largest financial institutions of its time. The federal government owned 20\% of the shares, while private investors held the majority, creating a public-private partnership. Its governance included a board of 25 directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.

The bank issued its own notes to standardize currency, acted as a check on state banks by demanding specie (gold or silver) redemption of their notes, and served as a fiscal agent for the government, managing deposits, public debt, and tax collection. It also provided loans to businesses and individuals, stimulating economic growth. Despite its successes, the bank faced criticism for its influence over the economy and concerns about corruption due to its mix of public and private ownership. Its ability to operate across state lines also sparked opposition from those wary of centralized financial power.

The charter granted the Second Bank a 20-year term, expiring in 1836. While the bank contributed to economic stability and growth, it became a focal point of political conflict, particularly during the "Bank War." President Andrew Jackson strongly opposed its renewal, accusing the institution of favoring the elite and threatening democratic principles. Ultimately, the charter’s controversial provisions and the broader debate over centralized banking shaped its legacy and influenced the evolution of American financial systems.

In the file titled: 1st and 2nd US Bank you will be able to find a detailed table displaying the key differences between the two banks.
